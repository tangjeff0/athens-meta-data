  "body":"- Auto-deploy to GH pages for both athensresearch and contributor forks. One-click setup for contributors â€” just turn it on in the Actions tab of your fork.\r\n- Loading spinner for app shows the relevant commit if deployed from GH Actions\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-23 at 12 31 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8952138/85429987-88c5e000-b54d-11ea-865e-5093afbd682e.png)\r\n- `/script/deploy` calls `shadow-cljs` directly because it's faster than `lein compile`\r\n- Compiles both `devcards` and `app`\r\n- Unfortunately, unable to compile both builds concurrently with `&`. My guess is that it's because CI VM only has 2 cores https://github.com/tangjeff0/athens/runs/799993783?check_suite_focus=true\r\n- Caches yarn/npm modules now\r\n- `lein prod` still doesn't work. haven't looked into it yet",
