It is agnostic to backend DB, but offers a well developed and tested frontend DB and data sync abstraction, as well as a beautiful model for front end composition. A UI with potentially duplicated information such as backlinks and sidebar views would fit fulcro's model well in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIf this is a direction you wish to explore, I would be interested in spiking out a branch to get to feature parity to current state with fulcro.

      "body":"### The value proposition of Fulcro\r\n\r\nI can try to elaborate on this a little. I have transferred to Fulcro 3 months ago (motivated by the pain of our Redux JS code) and have built one prod app with it so I am no expert - on the other hand, perhaps I can still see it somewhat \"from the outside.\" Unfortunately I cannot directly compare the respective tradeoffs and consequences of Fulcro vs. Reagent since it is a while since I have used Reagent. It also doesn't really make sense to compare Fulcro and Reagent because Reagent (and excuse all my misconceptions, it has been a while, as mentioned) concerns itself primarily with the view and local state while Fulcro is a full-stack solution. @aisamu hints at what the difference means.\r\n\r\nThe two big things are (David Nolen's talk on [Om Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByNs9TG30E8) provides the motivation and background for both):\r\n\r\n#### (1) Graph API\r\n\r\nYou already understand and appreciate the value proposition of Pathom/GraphQL so I won't go into that more than saying that all the data for a page is fetched in one request and the page decides exactly what (tree of) data it wants. For those interested, Wilker Lucio's talk [Scaling Full-Stack Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyVKf2U8YVg) is a good motivator.\r\n\r\n#### (2) Co-location\r\n\r\nWith Fulcro you define the data needs of a component directly on the component (as its query), next to the place where the data is used. That makes perfect sense to me - when I need to change the one, I typically also need to change the other. Having those separate makes for harder maintenance.\r\n\r\n#### The other facets\r\n\r\n##### DRY: Data normalization\r\n\r\nThe Graph API delivers a tree of data and the components make up a tree of UI components (likely a super-tree of the data tree). But Fulcro mediates between the two and stores the data in a normalized, simple form. So when a piece of data changes (on the client or server), all places that use it see the new value. Again, less maintenance headaches.\r\n\r\n##### Built-in data loading\r\n\r\nHow do you get data from the server into you components? With Fulcro, leveraging the defined queries, there is a single solution - the `load!` function. And it has built-in status tracking (loading?, failed?, finished). You can load the whole data tree or decide to load parts of it on-demand or load parts in parallel - it is all there for you. The only thing you need to do is to declare what data your component needs and write the Pathom resolver(s) that can provide the data. Actually loading the data, getting it into the state where it belongs, getting it into your component - is taken care of.\r\n\r\n##### & more\r\n\r\nState machines for complex user interactions, form support (with undo and diffing to make persisting the changes trivial), ... .\r\n\r\n### Is it suitable for Athens?\r\n\r\nI have no idea. I don't know enough about it to be able to judge that.\r\n",

So I thought my **opinions** and thoughts could bring some value. \r\n\r\nNot considering any specific use case and only speaking generally, I think Fulcro is a lot harder than Reagent, but it is because Fulcro can do a lot more than Reagent can. Individual concepts are quite small and, for me at least, easy to learn. I'd argue that if you know the ins and outs of both, you get more leverage having chosen Fulcro as the complexity of your application bloats. Also, if you really need ease, you can just opt out of using more advanced Fulcro features (form state, dynamic routing, ui state machines) and stick to the basics (stateful component, mutation, load, transact). Eventually you might notice that not using the advanced features make your code more complex, you learn the new concepts and make your code simpler.\r\n\r\nWith great leverage comes great learning curve.",
