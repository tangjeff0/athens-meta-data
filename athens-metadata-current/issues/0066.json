We have [Google Closure](https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.i18n.DateTimeFormat.html) already available or [cljs-time](https://github.com/andrewmcveigh/cljs-time). Please tell us the tradeoffs between these two, other libs, or if we should roll our own, etc.\r\n\r\nHere are some notes I took:\r\n- CLJS\r\n    - `cljs-time`\r\n        - Imitates the API of the `clj-time` library\r\n            - Not a drop-in replacement though\r\n        - Leans on Google Closure `goog.date` library for basic date/time functionality\r\n        - Date objects are mutable\r\n            - But operations that alter a date object return a copy\r\n            - Looking to move towards immutability\r\n        - Limited timezone functionality (but that is a JS issue)\r\n        - Good test coverage\r\n        - Good for keeping a consistent API across client and server\r\n            - But equality in goog.date and JS dates are not the same as in `clj-time` though, so you can use their own `=` operator\r\n        - Can also serialize\r\n        - Easy library to learn\r\n- CLJS / CLJ\r\n    - `juxt/tick`\r\n        - Replacement for `clj-time`\r\n        - Runs on JVM and JS runtime\r\n        - Alpha but ready to use\r\n            - Expect minor changes\r\n            - Not heavily documented\r\n        - Built on top of `cljc.java-time`\r\n            - Provides a single `ns`\r\n            - Batteries-included\r\n            - Power tools (interval algebra and scheduling)\r\n- JS\r\n    - `Luxon`\r\n        - Built by the guy who maintained `moment.js` but with immutable dates\r\n        - Better time zone and API names according to author\r\n        - Use directly or create wrappers\r\n    - `goog.date`\r\n        - Already included in the Closure library\r\n        - Simplest solution\r\n        - Use directly or create wrappers\r\n        - Probably will require utility functions\r\n    - `date-fns`\r\n        - Uses existing native type and does not extend core objects\r\n        - Functional programming submodule for composition\r\n        - Pure functions\r\n        - Immutable by default\r\n    - `moment.js`\r\n        - Defacto JS library\r\n        - OOP APIs\r\n        - Most powerful\r\n        - Big bundle\r\n    - `day.js`\r\n        - Tiny replacement for `moment.js`\r\n            - Same API\r\n\r\nMy first choice was `cljs-time` as I'm already familiar with `cli-time`, but I'm a little worried that the dates are mutable even though the functions return copies. Not sure what could happen but seems to go against Clojure's paradigm. The other thing that troubles me is that it mimics `clj-time` but is not compatible with the backend. I think `juxt/tick` could be a better solution, this is what the author wrote about the difference between using `tick` and using `cljs-time` and `clj-time` for a full-stack app: \r\n\r\n> Most Clojure applications use clj-time which is based on Joda Time. However, cljs-time objects are mutable goog.date objects which in turn wrap JavaScript Date objects.\r\n\r\n> This works OK as a proxy for Instant, but is not a great foundation for local dates etc.\r\n\r\n> The author of cljs-time, Andrew McVeigh, has said he would ideally move cljs-time off goog.date but is unlikely to do so at this point. For one thing, there could be more than a few current users relying on the JS Date nature of the cljs-time objects.\r\n\r\n> Taking a fresh look at the date/time landscape, we now have java.time (JSR-310) and implementations in both Java and Javascript and so it is possible to create tick, which combines the excellent JSR-310 with an expressive, cross-platform Clojure(Script) API.\r\n\r\n> For some use cases it is possible to write cross-platform code with clj/s-time, conditionally requiring clj-time or cljs-time in a cljc file. In our experience though, the fact that cljs-time doesnâ€™t have complete fidelity with clj-time often comes to be a problem.",
