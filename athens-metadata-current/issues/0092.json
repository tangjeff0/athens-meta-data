  "body":"We were going to remove it at some point because in a change of plans, we decided to implement the first version of editing using textareas instead of contentEditable. Iâ€™m doing the removal now to solve these two problems caused by contentEditable:\r\n\r\n- It causes React to output warnings to the browser console, cluttering the console output:\r\n\r\n  > Warning: A component is `contentEditable` and contains `children` managed by React. It is now your responsibility to guarantee that none of those nodes are unexpectedly modified or duplicated. This is probably not intentional.\r\n\r\n- It prevents links within blocks from being clicked: clicking a link just places the cursor there.",
