  "body":"This is an unsolicited modification; I know that's a bit obnoxious, and I'm starting off on the wrong foot. Having said that, I tried to discuss on discord but after I followed the link, created an account, confirmed my email, and went to the channel I couldn't post. (The error was \"You do not have permission to send messages in this channel\" showed up in the chat submission box.)\r\n\r\nAnyway: this is basically an aesthetic/art-based pull request consisting of a modified version of the Athens photo that appears on the github front page. Since there's no code, there's nothing to actually \"push\"; so sorry again if I'm going about this the wrong way.\r\n\r\nIt is stylized to be highly pixelated in the upper left corner, and full-res in the bottom right.\r\n\r\nIt's meant to symbolize the functionality of Athens, which captures any information in the real world, and casts it in digital form.\r\n\r\nI permit all uses without restriction under a CC0 copyright, and hereby assign all future copyright to the github user \"athensresearch\".\r\n\r\nIf you don't like it, I'm totally fine with silent rejection :). I'll take the hint if the thread is closed :)\r\n\r\n![athens-puk-patrick-pixel-gradient](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8550951/86469799-2799cb80-bd08-11ea-9b0f-ea1e7cdfed78.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
