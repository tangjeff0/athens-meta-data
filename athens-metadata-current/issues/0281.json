Therefore it would be important for blocks / pages moved into a workspace to be copied into the workspace (instead of embedding them), while keeping a reference to the original. This could also serve as a way of versioning and allow the export of e.g. a whole essay with citations.\r\nWorkspaces could also be extended by introducing ‚Äûview modes‚Äú - different visualizations of the workspace content e.g. a graph view of just the workspace contents (instead of a graph of the whole DB), an outline view, a versioning view, a relationship view (how blocks relate to each other), etc. The view modes could also change automatically based on zoom level.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Refinement of the feature scope",
