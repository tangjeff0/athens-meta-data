      "body":"@HaojiXu I don’t understand exactly what problem you were running into with the Unicode character classes in the hashtag parsing regexp, but I wondered if it was related to browser support for that feature:\r\n\r\n- Unicode property escapes support table [on Can I use…][caniuse-support]\r\n- Unicode property escapes support table [on MDN][mdn-support]\r\n\r\nFrom those tables it seems that `\\p{…}` in regexps is supported in all modern browsers as well as Node since v10. However, Firefox only gained this support in the last month with the release of version 78. Were you testing on Firefox 77? If so, that could be the problem.\r\n\r\n[caniuse-support]: https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_property_escapes\r\n[mdn-support]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Browser_compatibility",
