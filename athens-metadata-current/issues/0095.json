Components read upstream changes via `model` and send changes\r\ndownstream via `dispatch-fn` or, if that's not present, fall back to `swap!`-ing\r\non `model`. Richer interactions with the environment all go through\r\n`subscribe-fn` and `dispatch-fn`.\r\n",

It's a trade-off though (see [the re-frame docs](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/FAQs/ViewsOnGlobalRegistration.md)), the global registration funcs are easy to use and end up just wrapping a lot of lovely pure functions you write as an app developer.\r\n\r\nre-frame includes some useful functionality that we'll need a solution for (e.g. event loop, interceptors) and some that we don't (e.g. subscriptions). Could we start by using re-frame for the parts we need but with a layer of indirection on top? That way we could gradually swap parts out as we develop our own solutions. re-frame isn't magic, but there's a lot of person-hours and knowledge embedded in it. The beauty of open source is we can use the parts we like!\r\n\r\nLong term, I'd love to see us pull our solution out into a re-frame-like library built on top of datoms/EQL, that's a little more pluggable.\r\n\r\nUltimately, my dream is to see 'Athens-in-Athens', which re-frame makes harder :smile: ",

What I meant was: when we need to use subscriptions over a global store, we can use re-frame's app-db instead of datascript+re-posh.\r\n\r\nI don't have many frustrations with global-ness or non-determinism of re-frame but now that you have pointed out:\r\n\r\n> global registration funcs are easy to use and end up just wrapping a lot of lovely pure functions you write as an app developer\r\n\r\nI am also leaning towards using reagent components with local states.

As you already pointed out we need a re-frame like library built on top of datums but building that up from scratch will be a huge task. However, I am not clear yet how this indirection layer would look like. It would be interesting to explore what kind of API this indirection layer provides 🤔 \r\n\r\nAlso, I like the idea of \"Athens-in-Athens\" 👍   \r\nPerhaps this can even make it easy to put Athens on multiple platforms in the future like mobile, desktop etc.",

This makes DevCards a lot easier to work with too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe don't need re-posh. I'm not entirely sure what posh does either because some of our components use `posh/query`, while some use `d/query`, and I haven't noticed a difference.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome use cases I can see for re-frame:\r\n\r\n- booting the app\r\n- async requests\r\n- localStorage\r\n- keybindings\r\n- routing\r\n\r\nAny others?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, would love to use EQL long-term!
