Notion tables are second only to Airtable tables.\r\n- Usability. Notion is the most general-purpose tool, in terms of both function and form. I imagine many end-users of Athens won't code, and I would prefer to steer away from the connotation of git, whether that be GitBooks or Github wiki.\r\n\r\nThe downside to Notion is that it is necessarily hosted (until we make an open-source version ðŸ¤”).
