  "body":"[Demo](https://shanberg.github.io/athens/)\r\n\r\nThis one scares me a little because of how much is happening at the highest levels of UI code. This is probably being far too clever and brittle, but I haven't found any actual or theoretical problems yet.\r\n\r\n**How it works:**\r\n- Textareas are absolutely positioned over their respective blocks.\r\n- Textareas are invisible and display: none by default.\r\n- Hovering a block enables the textarea so that it can be clicked.\r\n- Interactible elements in blocks are z-indexed above the textarea so they can be clicked.\r\n- Regular text in a block is behind the textarea, so is never clicked.\r\n- Clicks are passed through directly to the textarea so the textarea captures the click location.\r\n- Focusing a textarea makes it opaque and in front, and textareas are also triggered by `editing-uid`\r\n\r\n**Issues**\r\n- Actual text editing isn't working, but that was true before these changes.\r\n- The textarea of the block you're currently editing can be taller than the block space, so it overlaps following blocks.\r\n- `editing-uid` isn't toggled off when you click outside the textarea. Clicking outside the textarea blurs it, but editing state remains. This leaves room for some weird stuff like parsed block text appearing over a focused textarea.\r\n- Clicking on block contents triggers some state, which may or may not be interrupting the :focus behavior of an already-editing textarea.",
