  "body":"This commit add the github action to deploy `resource/public` to vercel. There's a demo PR [here](https://github.com/yqrashawn/athens-fork-for-gh-actions/pull/5). I have to create an unforked repo to tweak the gh action.\r\n\r\nThere're several things need to be done before making this possible.\r\n1. create a vercel account at https://vercel.com/\r\n2. create a vercel token at https://vercel.com/account/tokens as `VERCEL_TOKEN`\r\n3. install the [vercel cli](https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/packages/now-cli) with `yarn global add vertical` or `npm install vercel -g`\r\n4. cleanup `resource/public` folder, remove files generated by `lein dev` (too much files may reach vercel's free account upload limit)\r\n5. at root dir of athens, run `vercel --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN`\r\n\t- `Set up and deploy “/path/to/athens”? [Y/n]`: **yes**\r\n\t- `Link to existing project? [y/N]`: **no**\r\n\t- `What’s your project’s name?` **athens**\r\n\t- `In which directory is your code located?` **./**\r\n\t- `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`: **yes**\r\n\t- `Which settings would you like to overwrite (select multiple)? Build Command, Output Directory, Development Command`: **choose all three options with space and arrow key**\r\n\t\t- `Build Command`: **leave empty**\r\n\t\t- `Output Directory`: **resources/public**\r\n\t\t- `Development Command`: **leave empty**\r\n\r\n6. there will be a `.vercel/project.json` file created in athens root dir\r\n7. open https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/settings/secrets\r\n\t- add `VERCEL_TOKEN` same as above\r\n\t- add `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` with the value `orgId`, `projectId` from `.vercel/project.json`\r\n\r\nThen the action should work fine.",

People could be granted contributor status to be able to push branches to this repo, so they're PR's would be able to run the github action.  But that hurts the contribution experience for anyone new who submits a PR from a fork since they wont get access to PR deploys.\r\n\r\nOther than that we could adopt a separate CI/CD tool other than Github actions?  I've never used it, but the envoy proxy project uses circleci and it seems to integrate well 🤷 https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/11148\r\n\r\nThat being said, Github actions are **so** easy so it's a real bummer to have to adopt something more advanced",
