  "body":"[Demo](https://shanberg.github.io/athens/#/)\r\n\r\nSidebar should no longer appear open-ish for a couple frames before hiding itself.\r\n\r\n- Refactor sidebar toggling to use regular CSS transitions rather than CSS animation, because of difficulty setting the initial state properly.\r\n- Sidebar should open and close more smoothly now, though it could still be better. Currently itâ€™s using negative margins to slide the content out of the way, and it'd be better if that used a CSS transform, which is allowed to run on the GPU and won't trigger content reflow. That'd be a small optimization though.",
