  "body":"Thanks for your contribution on this issue - I love how you explained your coding style from your experience and was able to relate to other people from that experience. Now I see your point in full light, I wholeheartedly agree.\r\n\r\nOn another note, my mindset gave too much weight on other incoming \"occasional & inexperienced\" contributors over existing contributors. Ideally we'd like something with a literate programming paradigm so that end-user programming could be more powerful and integrated, but for now we can stick with what we have.\r\n\r\nRegarding my upcoming contributions, I'll look into clojure metaprogramming first and try to implement some user-programmable components (after discussing the specs with you guys), then we could have more conversations regarding the backend. Kanbans & queries aren't a priority on my list because they're relatively independent and could make a great training ground for newly-graduated learners :)",
