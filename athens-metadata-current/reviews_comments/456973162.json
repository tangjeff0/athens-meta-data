Athens has an open attitude for components: we believe that it is an important part of end-user programming. Thus, users can not only contribute to the components directory through this repository (following the general components syntax), but can also add custom components directly in the user-end, then share it with the entire Athens community (coming soon).\n+\n+This documentation provides a technical overview regarding how Athens components are processed in the frontend. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue!\n+\n+## How Components are Parsed\n+\n+The Athens [parser](./parser.md) considers everything in double curly brackets (`{{}}`) a component. You can have all kinds of syntaxes in a component, as the everything in the component is matched using regular expressions first and could be further parsed using instaparse if it has a more complex syntax.\n+\n+After the parsing process, the `:component` list would be a variadic list in which the first element is the unparsed string for more efficient pattern matching while rest of the elements are parsed tree for things like dynamic references & auto page creation. Will add documentation.\n+\n+Relavant code:",
