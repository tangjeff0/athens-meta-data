However, our ability to make sense of these inputs, to convert data and information to knowledge and wisdom, is already capped by the mainstream tools today.\n+\n+Using a graph database, bi-directional links, and hypertext transclusions, Roam enables users to create and traverse knowledge in a way that mirrors how humans organically create knowledge — associatively and contextually.\n+\n+By breaking out of the \"file-and-cabinet\" hierarchical paradigm that most computer systems use — note-taking apps,  filesystems, HTML documents, etc. — Roam users can more easily create meaningful relationships about the world we live in. Not only that, users can then more easily recontextualize relationships, allowing ideas to compose and refactor in emergent ways. This leads to the creation of more insights, more interdisciplinary insights, and generative insights: insights that create more interdisciplinary insights.\n+\n+In short, we are currently experiencing diminishing and marginal returns on information. Roam promises exponential and compound returns.\n+\n+That's Roam. But this is Athens. So why Athens, why open-source? Because Roam always should've been open-source.\n+\n+Many users already report that they are getting massive returns on their Roam databases. They've found perhaps the currently closest approximation to [Vannevar Bush's memex](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). Users right now are putting their entire personal lives, unencrypted, on Roam and therefore Google Firebase.\n+\n+This isn't about Roam's ethics, either. This is about users putting their second brains — their entire lives — on a public cloud. In plain-text. To be summoned at will by the government ([Facebook Transparency](https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests/country/US), [Google Transparency](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en)).\n+\n+A self-hosted Athens solves this privacy and security problem.\n+\n+# An Invidual Memex\n+\n+The closest approximations we have to the brain are Roam and neural networks. Both of these are graphs with bi-directional data flows.\n+\n+What makes Roam different from other Tools for Thought is bi-directional links and transclusions (which are just richer bi-directional links).\n+\n+Of course, it's not *just* bi-directional links. Any note-taking app can support bi-directional links with some string parsing. It's also the fact that Roam is built on top of a graph database.\n+\n+To acquire exponential returns on knowledge, we will need to be able to navigate and manipulate exponentially large datasets. Datasets that approach Wikipedia and Google scale.\n+\n+We will need specific features like graph visualizations as well as an industrial data query language (Datalog) that can represent and operate on thousands if not millions of nodes and blocks.\n+\n+Knowledge at scale requires a data model that is more robust than a collection of markdown files.\n+\n+Athens has implemented bi-directional links and transclusions. This can be and has been done in under 100 lines of Clojure and Datascript.\n+\n+Everything else — the sidebar, queries, the graph visualization — are being redesigned from the ground up.\n+\n+- How might tables and queries in Athens be as powerful as tables in Airtable, Notion, or Excel?\n+- How might we more fully leverage our spatial and visual senses with a dynamic and interactive knowledge graph? See [interactive graph visualization (#21)](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/21).\n+- What if Athens was as extensible as Emacs and Vim? As interactive as Smalltalk and LightTable? And most importantly, as easy as Myspace? See [plugin architecture (#63)](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/63).\n+\n+# A Collective Memex\n+\n+The closest approximation we have to a global brain is the Web. But even still, the Web is far from a collective memex.\n+\n+As already mentioned, a memex is probably a bi-directional graph, whereas the Web is only uni-directional.\n+\n+This means the Web needs bi-directionality within more apps. And then it needs bi-directionality between apps.\n+\n+## A Protocol for Bi-directionality\n+\n+The Web should've always have been bi-directional. The reason why it's not is because it's a security nightmare. Letting someone write to your website or server by simply linking to your domain necessarily opens you up to malicious exploits. There have been a [few unsuccessful attempts at notifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback) when someone links to your blog. Even these have led to [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback).\n+\n+We need a chat messenger like the one [Max Krieger](http://a9.io/glue-comic/) envisions. Chat is one of the clearest examples of diminishing returns on knowledge. If you don't check Slack for one day, you'll never catch up. Even if you do, good luck finding it again. Furthermore, aside from these diminishing returns on data, conversations are naturally networked and self-referential. But all we have right now is a ceasless tidal wave of messages represented as an append-only log. Managing it all with search, one level of threads, and channels is Sisyphean at best.",
