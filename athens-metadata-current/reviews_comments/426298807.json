  "body":"There's two potential reasons, one I think is more likely than the other. The first, unlikely, reason is that textarea is a form element so using content-editable means having to manually handle submission (seems trivial using on blur). The second, more likely reason, is that content-editable preserves the styling unlike textarea, so I'm thinking maybe they tried content-editable first but were not able to implement their custom styling syntax with the way content-editable works. Or they just wanted the user to see plain unformatted text when they are editing and it is a design decision rather than a technical one. We won't know until we reach that stage.",
