  "body":"I think if a contributor wanted to add a component, they would look through the previous components to see how it's done. How else would they know how to make a component? If you hadn't read the blocks file, how would you have known how to make the auto-page link feature?\r\n\r\nIf someone hasn't read the relevant parts of the codebase, then yes I don't think they are ready to contribute yet, assuming they are somehow even able to complete a PR without this prerequisite knowledge.\r\n\r\nMaybe a big file is intimidating, but it's tractable. Having to look through more files in a new codebase is worse because 1) you have to know the file exists and 2) you may need to read it anyways, we wouldn't know ahead of time.\r\n\r\nI don't know what you intend to do with metaprogramming so I don't know if it would confuse people or not having it in multiple files. Please elaborate before you try to use that as support for what you want to do. Like kanban, query, backends (on Discord), and the docs in this PR, I believe you're making too many jumps too soon.\r\n\r\nThis convo sounds nitpicky. But part of what I'm saying comes from my experience doing DevOps, where I architected and implemented our company's entire CI build from manual deploys. In one project I implemented monorepos with [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and yarn workspaces. Scattering logic across multiple repos (or files in this case), increases the burden on the developer. This is especially true here where the developer just needs to look at relevant code. It's easier if it's one file.\r\n\r\nI admit, there aren't unanimous best practices for separation of files, which is why we're having this conversation. Mono vs many is still up for debate. PurelyFunctional disagrees with re-frame themselves on putting `subs` and `events` into separate files ([source](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/database-structure-in-re-frame/#events-and-subscriptions)). Some Clojurians have argued separating namespaces into `clj` `cljs` and `cljc` is bad practice. Here, I don't believe your points are well-formed enough to convince me otherwise.",
