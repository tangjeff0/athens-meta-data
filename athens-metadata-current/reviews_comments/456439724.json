  "body":"Your `atom` skills have leveled ðŸ†™  I would probably merge the atoms into atom. Clojurians typically like to co-locate all stateful (read: bad) things in one place. This is good from a design perspective.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to keep state together is that it's just one less variable/parameter we have to keep track of. For example, it would not be great if we had an individual atom for each key-value in `block-component`.\r\n\r\nSomething that I haven't explained properly, and I don't think I fully understand it yet either, is why sometimes we create the atom in `x-el` and sometimes in `x-component`.",
