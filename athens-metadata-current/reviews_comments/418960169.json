(To be updated soon.)\n+1. Download a `java` JDK. You can download the most [current version](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or access the [JDK archives](https://jdk.java.net/archive/).\n+2. Download a package manager: [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). \n+3. Download and install the lein package manager (lein installs the correct version of Clojure for you). Detailed instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows are below.\n+\n+### On Linux:\n+   * Install curl command\n+> ```sudo apt-get install -y curl```\n+   * Download the lein script\n+> ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein```\n+   * Move the lein script to the user programs directory\n+> ```sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein```\n+   * Add execute permissions to the lein script\n+> ```sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein```\n+   * Verify your installation\n+> ```lein version```\n+   \n+   It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. See the note at the end of this section if you are having issues.\n+\n+### On macOS:\n+   * Download the lein script\n+> ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein > lein```\n+   * Move the lein script to the user programs directory\n+> ```sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/lein```\n+   * Add execute permissions to the lein script\n+> ```sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein```\n+   * Verify your installation\n+> ```lein version```\n+\n+   It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. See the note at the end of this section if you are having issues.\n+\n+### On Windows:\n+   * Download the lein.bat script\n+> ```curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.bat```\n+   * Create a bin directory for scripts\n+> ```md bin```\n+   * Move the lein.bat script to that directory\n+> ```move lein.bat bin```\n+   * Add bin to your path\n+> ```setx path \"%path%;%USERPROFILE%\\bin\"```\n+   * Complete your installation\n+   Close the command prompt and open a new one. Then run the following command to finish the installation.\n+> ```lein self-install```\n+   \n+   It should take a while to run, as it will download some resources it needs the first time. See the note at the end of this section if you are having issues.\n+\n+4. Clone the repo found [here](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens). Change directory to the athens folder and run one of the following commands:\n+> ```yarn install```\n+\n+> ```npm install```",
