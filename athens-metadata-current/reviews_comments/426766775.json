  "body":"Yeah regal could be nice at some point, especially when we want to do generative testing. But we don't need it yet, so I think the current changes are fine. Since we have many new clojure people here, it is also good to not make too many steps at once, people have an easier time to understand the steps. We can upgrade the regexp's to Regal later. \r\n\r\nRegarding instaparse, yes we need that for the markdown parsing at least. Instaparse supports regexp's as well. Maybe there is some overlap here. Let's wait and see.\r\n\r\n(*) I personally also don't have experience with Regal yet, but I'm sure it's good.",
